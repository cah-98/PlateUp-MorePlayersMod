# PlateUp-MorePlayersMod
Mod that adds more players to PlateUp.

Instructions:
1. Navigate to your plateup-folder (Where your plateup.exe is).
2. Extract the files from BepInEx.zip into the plateup-folder.
3. Start the game and wait for the main menu to load.
4. Close the game.
5. Extract the dll file from PlateUpMorePlayers.zip into plateup-folder/BepInEx/plugins.
6. Start the game and wait for the main menu to load.
7. Close the game.
8. Go to plateup-folder/BepInEx/config and open MorePlayers.cfg with a text editor (eg. notepad).
9. Change the Max players to whatever you wish between 4 and theoretically 128 (Due to it being the max steam lobbies supports, however i have not tested it for that many players).
10. Change the Player confirmation count to any value between 0 and 1 (eg 0.5 for 50% of players). This changes how many players need to ready up for things.
11. Save the file.
12. Start the game up and invite some friends! They also require the mod however!

Extra note: Everyone has to join the lobby before anyone presses the buttons to create a character. Otherwise you will only be allowed four players. This is due to a small bug i haven't figured out yet.
