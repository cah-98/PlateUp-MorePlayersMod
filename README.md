# PlateUp-MorePlayersMod
Mod that adds more players to PlateUp.

Instructions:
1. Navigate to your plateup-folder (Where your plateup.exe is).
2. Extract the files from BepInEx.zip into the plateup-folder.
3. Start the game and wait for the main menu to load.
4. Close the game.
5. Extract the dll file from PlateUpMorePlayers.zip into plateup-folder/BepInEx/plugins.
6. Start the game and wait for the main menu to load.
7. Close the game.
8. Go to plateup-folder/BepInEx/config and open MorePlayers.cfg with a text editor (eg. notepad).
9. Change the Max players to whatever you wish between 4 and theoretically 128 (Due to it being the max steam lobbies supports, however i have not tested it for that many players).
10. Save the file.
11. Start the game up and invite some friends! They also require the mod however!

Extra note: Everyone has to join the lobby before anyone presses the buttons to create a character. Otherwise you will only be allowed four players. This is due to a small bug i haven't figured out yet.
